   - inputs: *an entire image*, *a set of object proposals*
   - several convolutional and max pooling layers -> produce a conv feature map
   - for each object proposal: a RoI(region of interest) pooling layer extracts a 
     fixed-length feature vector from the feature map
   - each feature vector is fed into a sequence of fully connected(fc) layers 
     that finally branch into two sibling(兄弟，姐妹，同属) output layers:
     *one* that produces softmax probability estimates over K object classes
     plus a catch-all "background" class and *another layer* that outputs 
     four real-valued numbers for each of the K object classes.
     ? 2. /Each set of 4 values encodes refined bounding-box positions for one of
           the K classes./
