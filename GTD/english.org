  - broadly

    For 3D segmentation, known DL schemes can be broadly classified into four categories.

  - hybrid
    
    3D convolutions can be employed to replace 2D convolutions [10], or combined with 2D
    convolutions into a hybrid network.

  - planar,voxel
    
    Tri-planar schemes (e.g., [15]) apply three 2D convolutional networks based on orthogonal 
    planes (i.e., the xy, yz, and xz planes) to perform voxel classification.

  - incorporate,incur
    
    Incorporating 3D convolutions may incur extremely high computation costs.

  - commensurate
    
    Skip-layer connections exist between each downsampled feature map and the commensurate upsampled feature map.
